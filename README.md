# MSDB
This repository contains all the source code for the 'Movies & Shows database' app project.

## Overview
With this app a user can search for movies and show. It will also allow them to see the cast of the movie. This app was built using react-native and uses the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to make a GET request for movies and shows. 

## Future
Currently I have the basic functionalities I intended to have. The next step would be to view a list of actors, search for them and look at the movies they played in. I also want to add related movies, shows and actors to the details of a movie, show or actor. There is also some extra styling that needs to be done at the tabs.
