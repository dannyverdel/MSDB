# MSDB [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dannyverdel/msdb.svg)](https://github.com/dannyverdel/MSDB/blob/main/LICENSE)

MSDB is a app built with react native to let user browse for movies, shows and actors. It currently doesn't contain much, this will change in the near future. I will implement more features and perform more code cleanup.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended, MSDB is built using the expo CLI in react native.

Start by cloning the repository with `https://github.com/dannyverdel/MSDB`.

## The Plan
The plan for MSDB is really simple: to create an app for letting users browse for movies, shows and actors. These basic features already exist but there are other features I want to add that are listed below. The development of this app is rather slow because I also have school to work on and also have a job I really enjoy working.

### Main features to come:
- Create a connection between the cast of a movie and the actor detail screen
- Create a connection between the cast of a show and the actor detail screen
- Create a connection between known movies of an actor and the movie detail screen

## Build
After cloning the repository you have to cd to the local repository. Here you can run `npm start`. You may be prompted to install npm or the expo CLI, both are required for this app to run. Localhost:19002 should automatically be started up, if not u can use [this](http://localhost:19002). After this you have two options:
1. Choose to start up a simulator
2. Run on physical device

For both you are going to have to install the expo go app.
