MSDB is a app built with react native to let user browse for movies, shows and actors. It currently doesn't contain much, this will change in the near future. I will implement more features and perform more code cleanup.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended, MSDB is built using the expo CLI in react native.

Start by cloning the repository with `https://github.com/dannyverdel/MSDB`.

## The Plan
The plan for MSDB is really simple: to create an app for letting users browse for movies, shows and actors. These basic features already exist but there are other features I want to add that are listed below. The development of this app is rather slow because I also have school to work on and also have a job I really enjoy working.

### Main features to come:
- Create a connection between the cast of a movie and the actor detail screen
- Create a connection between the cast of a show and the actor detail screen
- Create a connection between known movies of an actor and the movie detail screen
