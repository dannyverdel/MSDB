# MSDB
This repository contains all the source code for the 'Movies & Shows database' app project.

## Overview
With this app a user can search for movies and show. It will also allow them to see the cast of the movie. This app was built using react-native and uses the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to make a GET request for movies and shows. 

## Future
I currently have a fully working app. For now I am going to leave this project to rest. A future feature might be searching for actors and accessing actor details trough the cast of a movie or show. Another thing i would like to do is extract API logic into a hook in order to clean up and clarify the code.
