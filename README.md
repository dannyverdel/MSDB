# MSDB
App for searching movies and shows and taking a look at them in detail. It will also allow you to see the cast of the movie. This app was built using react-native and uses the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to make a GET request for movies and shows.

## Future
Currently I have the basic functionalities I intended to have. The next step would be to view a list of actors, search for them and look at the movies they played in. I also want to add related movies, shows and actors to the details of a movie, show or actor. There is also some extra styling that needs to be done at the tabs.

## Installation
In order to install this project you first have to clone this project and navigate to the MSDB/MSDB directory. Once here run the following command.

```
npm install
```

next to start-up the project run 

```
npm start
```

When you run this command it might ask you to install 'expo-cli'. Enter 'Y' to start this installation and after it installed it should start up Expo Developer Tools. From here you can either choose to open a simulator or download the expo go app on a physical device and scan the QR code. Then the project should start up.
