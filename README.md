# MSDB
This repository contains all the source code for the 'Movies & Shows database' app project.

This product uses the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API but is not endorsed or certified by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Overview
This is a project that uses react native to build an app, the goal is to display a list of movies which you can click and look at in detail. The same goes for TV shows. This project is open source so that others can clone this repo and test the app themselves. The other reason is to have contributors help me improve my code so I can learn from them.

**! BE AWARE !** <br>
If you decide to use this yourself and make changes. According to the terms of use of [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) it is required to have the logo in the app, it should also mention the following somewhere: 'This product uses the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API but is not endorsed or certified by [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).'

## Future
I currently have a unstyled list of movie titles and have set up the API. The next step is to make a ListItem component that is reusable for both Movies and Shows and give styling to this list component. But before I do that I am going to implement a theme.
